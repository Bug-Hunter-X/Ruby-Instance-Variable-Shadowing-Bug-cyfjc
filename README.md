This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to instance variable shadowing.  When a method is defined with the same name as an instance variable, the method takes precedence. Assigning a value through the method will not affect the actual instance variable's value. The solution shows how to correctly handle instance variables by avoiding naming conflicts or using different accessor methods.
